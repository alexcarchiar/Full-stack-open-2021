# Full-stack-open-2021
Hello!
This is my repository for the course Full Stack open that I am taking as part of my Master's degree studies. Here I will be publishing my solutions to the exercises I encounter.

The structure of the repository will be the following:
/
  README.md
  part0/
  part1/
  ...
  part5/
  
Each directory refers to a part of the course and the files I'll put in will be the solutions to the exercises.

Wish me good luck!
